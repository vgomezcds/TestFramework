### Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like PDF417.mobi in your projects. See the ["Getting Started" guide for more information](https://github.com/PDF417/pdf417-ios/wiki/Getting-started).

#### Podfile

```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod 'PPpdf417', '~> 4.2.2'
```

## Requirements

SDK package contains MicroBlink framework and one or more sample apps which demonstrate framework integration. Framework can be deployed on iOS 6.0 or later, iPhone 3GS or newer and iPad 2 or newer.

SDK performs significantly better when the images obtained from the camera are focused. Because of that, the SDK can have lower perfomance on iPad 2 and iPod Touch 4th gen devices, which [don't have camera with autofocus](http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/ipad-2-rear-camera-has-tap-for-auto-exposure-not-auto-focus/12536). 

## Important documents:

### ["Getting started" guide](https://github.com/PDF417/pdf417-ios/wiki/Getting-started)

See the steps for integrating the SDK in your apps. 

### [Release notes](https://github.com/PDF417/pdf417-ios/blob/master/Release%20notes.md)

See what's new in each new SDK version.

### [Transition guide](https://github.com/PDF417/pdf417-ios/blob/master/Transition%20guide.md)
